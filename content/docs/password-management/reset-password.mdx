# Reset Password Feature

The **Forgot Password** feature allows users to securely reset their password if theyâ€™ve forgotten it. By integrating this feature, you provide a user-friendly and secure way for users to regain access to their accounts.

## Step 1: Sending OTP for Verification (POST Request)

### Overview

In this step, an OTP (One-Time Password) is generated and sent to the user's registered email address to verify their identity during the password reset process.

### 1. Integration Example

```js
import { forgotPassword } from "email-armor";

let response = { message: "", status: 0 };

// Handle forgot password based on whether it's an email or username
if (userNameOrEmail.includes('@')) {
    const forgotPasswordResponse = await forgotPassword(userNameOrEmail, '', userAgent, userIP);
    response = { message: forgotPasswordResponse.message || "", status: forgotPasswordResponse.status };
} else {
    const forgotPasswordResponse = await forgotPassword('', userNameOrEmail, userAgent, userIP);
    response = { message: forgotPasswordResponse.message || "", status: forgotPasswordResponse.status };
}
```

| `400`           | Invalid userName!                                                                                                 |
| `400`           | Invalid Email!                                                                                                    |
| `400`           | Please Validate Your Details.                                                                                     |

| `429`           | OTP request limit exceeded. Please try again later.                                                               |
| `500`           | An unexpected error occurred. Please report this issue at [GitHub](https://github.com/Capta1nRaj/email-armor).    |

### 3. Success Response

A `201` response indicates that the OTP has been successfully sent to the user's email. The response will include:

```js
{ 
    message: "OTP sent to mail!", 
    status: 201 
}
```

## Step 2: Verifying OTP and Updating the Password (PUT Request)

Once the OTP has been sent and received, this step verifies the OTP and allows the user to update their password.

### 1. Integration

```js
import { forgotPassword } from "email-armor";
let response = { message: "", status: 0 };
// Handle password update based on whether it's an email or username
if (userNameOrEmail.includes('@')) {
    const signInResponse = await updatePassword(userNameOrEmail, '', userAgent, otp, newPassword);
    response = { message: signInResponse.message || "", status: signInResponse.status };
} else {
    const signInResponse = await updatePassword('', userNameOrEmail, userAgent, otp, newPassword);
    response = { message: signInResponse.message || "", status: signInResponse.status };
}
```
