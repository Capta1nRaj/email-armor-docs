# Why Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?

Two-step verification (2FA) provides an added layer of security by requiring users to verify their identity using a one-time password (OTP) sent to their registered email. This guide will show you how to configure the `signInVerify` function to implement secure user authentication.

## Configuring the 2FA Function

### 1. Integration (PUT Request)

When the user receives a `201` response, display the OTP input screen as demonstrated in our [SDK](https://github.com/Capta1nRaj/email-armor-demo). After capturing the OTP from the user, send the following request to your backend:

```js
import { signInVerify } from 'email-armor';

const response = await signInVerify(id, OTP, userAgent, 'verify', '');
// Retrieve 'id' from cookies
// `userAgent` is the name of the user's agent (e.g., browser, device, etc.)
```

### 2. Error Responses

| **Status Code** | **Message**                                                                                                       |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `400`           | Invalid OTP!                                                                                                      |
| `400`           | Invalid request method!                                                                                           |
| `401`           | Your device is unauthorized.                                                                                      |
| `404`           | Session not found.                                                                                                |
| `500`           | An unexpected error occurred. Please report this issue at [GitHub](https://github.com/Capta1nRaj/email-armor).    |

### 3. Success Response

Once you get a `202` response, it means the login was successful. The response will include the following details:

```js
{ 
    signedJWTToken: "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyTmFtZSI6InByaXlhbHJhajk5IiwidXNlckFnZW50IjoiJDJiJDEwJExSbVFpMm11Y1RUcjlGYy9YNUpRU09sYWFNWC91eXRucEtmR2Nid0FiOFFZR3hGd3hFZEFLIiwiaWF0IjoxNzI2MDIxMjA0LCJleHAiOjE3NTc1NTcyMDR9.w-trwD9Sim4Wuqad9S8ufwGFR46fmhrlcH8gRo6tn-E", 
    message: "Login Successful!", 
    status: 202 
};
```

### 4. Storing Cookies

After receiving the `202` response, you should store the signedJWTToken in cookies. Below is an example of how to store these values using Next.js:

```js
const expireIn365Days = new Date(Date.now() + 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);

// Set cookie token with a 365-day expiration.
cookies().set("token", signedJWTToken, { path: "/", domain: `${process.env.COOKIE_DOMAIN || "localhost"}`, expires: expireIn365Days });
```

> **Note:** You can use any method of cookie storage depending upon your tech stack.

## Resend OTP

If the user hasn't received the OTP or needs to resend it, use the following steps to handle the OTP resend.

### 1. Integration (PATCH Request)

```js
import { signInVerify } from 'email-armor';

const response = await signInVerify(id, 'NM85jm', userAgent, 'resend', userIP);
// Retrieve 'id' from cookies
// `userAgent` is the name of the user's agent (e.g., browser, device, etc.)
```


### 2. Error Responses

| **Status Code** | **Message**                                                                                                       |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `400`           | Invalid request method!                                                                                           |
| `400`           | You have exceeded the maximum number of OTP resend attempts.                                                      |
| `401`           | Your device is unauthorized.                                                                                      |
| `404`           | Session not found.                                                                                                |
| `500`           | An unexpected error occurred. Please report this issue at [GitHub](https://github.com/Capta1nRaj/email-armor).    |

### 3. Success Response

A successful resend request will return a `200` status code and the following response:

```js
{ 
    signedJWTToken: "", 
    message: "OTP has been resent to your email!", 
    status: 200 
};
```

## Configuring the Session Check Function

Once the `signIn` module is set up, the next step is to integrate the **session check function** to verify user sessions and ensure authenticated users have valid sessions during their interactions with your application.
