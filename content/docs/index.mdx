# What is Email Armor?

**Email Armor** is a powerful npm module designed for **Node.js** and **Next.js**, providing a secure and flexible authentication system with built-in **two-step verification** via **Nodemailer** (using GMAIL). The package also includes a robust referral system to encourage user engagement and growth. Currently, it supports **MongoDB** as the only database.

For a quick start, check out this [SDK](https://github.com/Capta1nRaj/email-armor-docs), where **Email Armor** has been seamlessly integrated with **Next.js**. You can clone the repository to jump-start your project with a pre-configured environment.
