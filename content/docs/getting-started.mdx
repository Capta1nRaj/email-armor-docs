description: Setting up Email Armor in your Next.js/Node.js Project
---

## 1. Install the package

To install the **Email Armor** package, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm i email-armor
```

## 2. Configure your .env file with the following values

Add the following key-value pairs to your **.env** file to set up the required environment variables:

```js
// MongoDB Connection
MONGODB_URI = mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/databaseName

// Nodemailer Configuration
NODEMAILER_USERNAME = your_email@gmail.com
NODEMAILER_PASSWORD = your_gmail_app_password
NODEMAILER_MAIL_FROM = "Subject + sender_email@example.com"

// Security and Authentication
BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS = 10
JWT_TOKEN_VALUE = your_256_bit_secret
EXPIRE_JWT_TOKEN = token_expiration_time

// Cookie Settings (For Subdomain Redirection)
COOKIE_DOMAIN = localhost
```

- [Ref. for BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt#a-note-on-rounds)
- [Ref. for EXPIRE_JWT_TOKEN](https://github.com/vercel/ms)

### Sample .env
```js
MONGODB_URI = mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/email-armor-demo
NODEMAILER_USERNAME = priyalraj@gmail.com
NODEMAILER_PASSWORD = thisisntrealpass
NODEMAILER_MAIL_FROM = Email Armor <priyalraj@gmail.com>
BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS = 10
JWT_TOKEN_VALUE = use-your-own-please
EXPIRE_JWT_TOKEN = 30d

// If your domain is https://priyalraj.com, set the cookie domain as shown below.
COOKIE_DOMAIN = .priyalraj.com
```

## 3. Generate/Update the configuration file

Run the following command to generate necessary configuration files:

```bash
npx email-armor init
```

- This will create two files: email-armor.json and email-template.html. You will be prompted to generate [schema/model](https://github.com/Capta1nRaj/email-armor/tree/main/models) files. Press Y to generate them or N to skip, then press Enter.

Once the files are generated, you can customize your email template by editing **email-template.html**.

> **Note**: Currently, only inline CSS is supported for email templates. You can use tools like GPT to help create more advanced templates if needed.

- You can also configure values such as the **Forgot Password title, referral points, and OTP limits** within email-armor.json.

After making any changes to email-armor.json or email-template.html, apply the updates by running:

```bash
npx email-armor init
```
