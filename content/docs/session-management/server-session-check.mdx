title: "Server Session Validation"
description: "Integrate the server session check function from the Email Armor module to ensure secure session validation."

# Brief

The `serverSessionCheck` function provides an extra layer of security by validating the session through the database, along with verifying the JWT token and user agent. This comprehensive approach ensures a more secure and reliable session validation process.

## Configuration for `serverSessionCheck` Function

### 1. Integration

To integrate the `serverSessionCheck` function, follow the steps below:

```js
// Retrieve headers for session verification
const headersList = headers();
const id = headersList.get('id');
const username = headersList.get('userName');
const jwtToken = headersList.get('token');

// Verify the session 
const response = await serverSessionCheck(username, id, jwtToken, userAgent);
// userAgent refers to the user's browser, device, or other identifying information.
```

### 2. Error Responses

| Status | Message                                                                                                       |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `400`  | Session doesn't exist.                                                                                        |
| `401`  | Your device is unauthorized.                                                                                  |
| `500`  | An unexpected error occurred. Please report this issue at [GitHub](https://github.com/Capta1nRaj/email-armor).|

### 3. Success Response

A `202` response indicates that the session is valid. The response will include the following details:

```js
{
    userName: priyalraj, 
    message: "Session exists.",
    status: 202
};
```

## Next Steps: Implementing the Reset Password Feature

With server session validation now in place, the next step is to set up a secure `reset password` feature. This will allow users to reset their passwords, utilizing session checks and email-based authentication for added security and protection.
