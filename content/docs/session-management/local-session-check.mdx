title: "Local Session Validation"
description: "Let's integrate the local session check function from the Email Armor module to validate a session quickly and efficiently."

# Brief

The `localSessionCheck` function verifies whether a JWT token is valid on the server side without requiring database validation, speeding up the session validation process.

## Configuration for `localSessionCheck` Function

### 1. Integration

```js
// Fetch headers for verification
const headersList = headers();
const username = headersList.get('userName');
const jwtToken = headersList.get('token');

// Verify the session
const response = await localSessionCheck(username, jwtToken, userAgent);
// userAgent = Name of the user's agent (e.g., browser, device, etc.)
```

### 2. Error Responses

| Status | Message                                                                                                       |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `202`  | Session exists.                                                                                               |
| `400`  | Session doesn't exist.                                                                                        |
| `401`  | Your device is unauthorized.                                                                                  |
| `500`  | An unexpected error occurred. Please report this issue at [GitHub](https://github.com/Capta1nRaj/email-armor).|

### 3. Success Response

When you receive a `202` response, it means the session exists. The response will include the following details:

```js
{
    userName: priyalraj, 
    message: "Session exists.",
    status: 202
};
```

## Final Step: Configuring the Server Session Check Function

We've covered how to integrate `localSessionCheck` for quick JWT token validation. Now, it's time to implement the more comprehensive `serverSessionCheck`, which performs a deeper validation by checking session data against the database. This robust method is ideal for critical API operations that require a higher level of security and thorough session verification.
